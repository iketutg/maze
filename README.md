Generate a maze using [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Prim.27s_algorithm)

The maze generation is heavily based on the [pyramid example](https://github.com/JoelOtter/termloop/blob/master/_examples/pyramid.go)
in the [termloop](https://github.com/JoelOtter/termloop) package.

## Installation

    go get -u github.com/peterhellberg/maze

## Example game

Iâ€™ve written a small game using the maze package and [ebiten](https://hajimehoshi.github.io/ebiten/)

![maze-game](http://assets.c7.se/skitch/Maze-20150718-105812.png)

    go get -u github.com/peterhellberg/maze/cmd/maze-game

Use the arrow keys to move the orange square to the blue finish square.
Exit the game with `Q` or `ESC`, restart with `R`
